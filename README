Compare the output of pants and sbt.

For sbt run:

```
sbt run
```

For pants run:
```
./pants run src/main/scala/example:app
```

Both sbt and pants able to call `getResource("db/migration/V1.sql")` and get back a URL, however only sbt receives list of URLs when calling `.getResources("db/migration")`.
